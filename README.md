# Regression-Unets_RGB_Video_Processing_Mobile_Applications_Project

1) Regression_Unets_ImageProcessing

This Project contains the code of image and video processing which is developed in pytorch framework.

Filters that applied for image processing are:
  1)CannyEdgeDetection
  2)GaussianBlur
  3)Emboss
  4)Blur
  5)Sharpen
  
2) Regression_Unets_VideoProcessing

This project contains the code of video processing which is developed in pytorch lightening framework.

Filters that applied for video processing are:

  1)Temporal Gaussian
  2)Temporal Median

  Sample entropy function is also implemented to calculate the entropies.
  
 3) scripts

Compute canada cluster related scripts that are implemented to execute the code are present in this.
